# You Don't Know JS
# Preface

I'm sure you noticed, but "JS" in the book series title is not an abbreviation for words used to curse about JavaScript, though cursing at the language's quirks is something we can probably all identify with!

From the earliest days of the web, JavaScript has been a foundational technology that drives interactive experience around the content we consume. While flickering mouse trails and annoying pop-up prompts may be where JavaScript started, nearly 2 decades later, the technology and capability of JavaScript has grown many orders of magnitude, and few doubt its importance at the heart of the world's most widely available software platform: the web.

But as a language, it has perpetually(不断的) been a target for a great deal of criticism, owing partly to its heritage but even more to its design philosophy. Even the name evokes, as Brendan Eich once put it, "dumb kid brother" status next to its more mature older brother "Java". But the name is merely an accident of politics and marketing. The two languages are vastly different in many important ways. "JavaScript" is as related to "Java" as "Carnival(狂欢节)" is to "Car".

Because JavaScript borrows concepts and syntax idioms(习语) from several languages, including proud C-style procedural roots as well as subtle, less obvious Scheme/Lisp-style functional roots, it is exceedingly(极其) approachable(亲切的) to a broad audience of developers, even those with just little to no programming experience. The "Hello World" of JavaScript is so simple that the language is inviting(诱人的) and easy to get comfortable with in early exposure.

While JavaScript is perhaps one of the easiest languages to get up and running with, its eccentricities(古怪) make solid mastery of the language a vastly less common occurrence than in many other languages. Where it takes a pretty in-depth knowledge of a language like C or C++ to write a full-scale program, full-scale production JavaScript can, and often does, barely scratch the surface of what the language can do.

> 熟练掌握 JS 的难度大于其他语言，细节很多。

Sophisticated concepts which are deeply rooted into the language tend instead to surface themselves in *seemingly* simplistic ways, such as passing around functions as callbacks, which encourages the JavaScript developer to just use the language as-is and not worry too much about what's going on under the hood.

> 有些复杂概念貌似简单，实则艰深。比如回调函数，多数前端人员认为它是理所应当。

It is simultaneously a simple, easy-to-use language that has broad appeal, and a complex and nuanced(微妙的) collection of language mechanics which without careful study will elude(使困惑) *true understanding* even for the most seasoned of JavaScript developers.

> 若不沉心研究，即使 JS 老手，也无法真正理解微妙的语言机制。

Therein lies the paradox of JavaScript, the Achilles' Heel of the language, the challenge we are presently addressing. Because JavaScript *can* be used without understanding, the understanding of the language is often never attained(达到).

> 即使不理解，也可以使用 JS。因此，很少有人会费力理解它。

## Mission

If at every point that you encounter a surprise or frustration in JavaScript, your response is to add it to the blacklist, as some are accustomed to doing, you soon will be relegated(使降级) to a hollow shell of the richness of JavaScript.

> 如果经常将 JS 当作黑盒，就无法窥见它的丰饶，空留一躯壳。

While this subset has been famously dubbed(授予称号) "The Good Parts", I would implore(恳求) you, dear reader, to instead consider it the "The Easy Parts", "The Safe Parts", or even "The Incomplete Parts".

> “精粹部分”，即“简单部分”、“安全部分”、甚至“不完整的部分”。

This *You Don't Know JavaScript* book series offers a contrary challenge: learn and deeply understand *all* of JavaScript, even and especially "The Tough Parts".

> 学习，深入理解所有的 JS，即使是难懂的部分。

Here, we address(作演讲) head on(迎面地) the tendency of JS developers to learn "just enough" to get by, without ever forcing themselves to learn exactly how and why the language behaves the way it does. Furthermore, we eschew(避免) the common advice to *retreat* when the road gets rough.

> 不要逃避，迎头硬干

I am not content, nor should you be, at stopping once something *just works*, and not really knowing *why*. I gently challenge you to journey down that bumpy(崎岖不平的) "road less traveled(少有人走的路)" and embrace all that JavaScript is and can do. With that knowledge, no technique, no framework, no popular buzzword acronym(首字母缩写) of the week, will be beyond your understanding.

> 知其然，更要知其所以然。

These books each take on specific core parts of the language which are most commonly misunderstood or under-understood, and dive very deep and exhaustively into them. You should come away from reading with a firm confidence in your understanding, not just of the theoretical, but the practical "what you need to know" bits.

The JavaScript you know *right now* is probably *parts* handed down to you by others who've been burned by incomplete understanding. *That* JavaScript is but a shadow of the true language. You don't *really* know JavaScript, *yet*, but if you dig into this series, you *will*. Read on, my friends. JavaScript awaits you.

## Summary

JavaScript is awesome. It's easy to learn partially, and much harder to learn completely (or even *sufficiently*). When developers encounter confusion, they usually blame the language instead of their lack of understanding. These books aim to fix that, inspiring a strong appreciation for the language you can now, and *should*, deeply *know*.

Note: Many of the examples in this book assume modern (and future-reaching) JavaScript engine environments, such as ES6. Some code may not work as described if run in older (pre-ES6) engines.
